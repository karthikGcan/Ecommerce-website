# Ecommerce-website
This Application based on  ecommerce website. Here we used angular material for FRONT-END and TYPESCRIPR for validation .In this project we used 5 APPS like product, category, order, user, payment. And also we used sterilizerâ€™s from django_restframework that will convert the model class that are created in the database into JSON format. Here we used REST API for communication between two application and for payment gateway we used Braintree. 
SO using this we can select the product and add in to card.
